This repository is from when I started to learn HTML and CSS for learning frontend web developement. 
This has very basic stuff like creating lists, adding classes and id to the HTML elements, using anchor tags to navigate to differnt pages, using inline css, learning to link external css files. I also explored various properties related to margins, padding, background colors, borders etc.
